/**
 * This code provides a port to Java of the minimal implementation of one member
 * of the PCG family of random number generators, which are fast, statistically
 * excellent, and offer a number of useful features.
 *
 * This original C code is derived from the full C implementation, which is in
 * turn derived from the canonical C++ PCG implementation. The C++ version has
 * many additional features and is preferable if you can use C++ in your
 * project.
